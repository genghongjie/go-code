This transform splits the lines in PCollection<String>, where each element is an individual word in Shakespeareâ€™s collected texts. As an alternative, it would have been possible to use a ParDo transform that invokes a DoFn (defined in-line as an anonymous class) on each element that tokenizes the text lines into individual words. The input for this transform is the PCollection of text lines generated by the previous TextIO.Read transform. The ParDo transform outputs a new PCollection, where each element represents an individual word in the text.
